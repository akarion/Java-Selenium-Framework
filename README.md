# Test automation framework - Java+Selenium+POM+TestNG+Maven

This is a basic framework to be used for frontend test automation.
Can be run locally or in a Docker container, just make sure you have one running (you can use this one from Dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/r/selenium/standalone-chrome) and correct IP/port configured in your test and launchRemoteBrowser() is used instead of launchBrowser().

Work in progress, next I will probably add a test runner that would handle Docker download/setup and test run automatically.

Harsh comments welcome, I'm always opene to constructive (and even not so much!) criticism. 

Enjoy :)
